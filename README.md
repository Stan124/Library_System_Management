# Library Management System using SQL Project --P2

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System  
**Database**: `Library_project_2`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. 

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: Created a database named `Library_project_2`.
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS branch;
CREATE TABLE branch
(
            branch_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            manager_id VARCHAR(10),
            branch_address VARCHAR(55),
            contact_no VARCHAR(15)
);


-- Create table "employees"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees
(
            emp_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            emp_name VARCHAR(25),
            position VARCHAR(15),
            salary INT,
            branch_id VARCHAR(25) -- FK

            member_name VARCHAR(25),
            member_address VARCHAR(75),
            reg_date DATE
);



-- Create table "issues_tatus"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS issued_status;
CREATE TABLE issued_status
(
            issued_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_member_id VARCHAR(10), -- FK
            issued_book_name VARCHAR(75),
            issued_date DATE,
            issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(25), -- FK
            issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10) -- FK
);



-- Create table "return_status"
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS return_status;
CREATE TABLE return_status
(
            return_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
            issued_id VARCHAR(10),
            return_book_name VARCHAR(75),
            return_date	DATE,
            return_book_isbn VARCHAR(20)
);

-- FOREIGN KEY
ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_members
FOREIGN KEY (issued_member_id)
REFERENCES members(member_id);

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_books
FOREIGN KEY (issued_book_isbn)
REFERENCES books(isbn);

ALTER TABLE issued_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_employees
FOREIGN KEY (issued_emp_id)
REFERENCES employees(emp_id);

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_branch
FOREIGN KEY (branch_id)
REFERENCES branch(branch_id);

ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_issued_status
FOREIGN KEY (issued_id)
REFERENCES issued_status(issued_id);

```

### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

**Task 1. Create a New Book Record**
-- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"

```sql
INSERT INTO books(isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
VALUES
('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
SELECT * FROM books;
```
**Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address**

```sql
UPDATE members 
SET member_address = '125 Main St'
WHERE member_id = 'C101';
SELECT * FROM members;
```

**Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table**
-- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS121';

DELETE FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_id = 'IS121'
```

**Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee**
-- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.

```sql
SELECT * FROM issued_status
WHERE issued_emp_id = 'E101';
```


**Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book**
-- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.

```sql
SELECT 
	issued_emp_id
	-- COUNT(issued_id) as total_book_issued
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_emp_id
HAVING COUNT(issued_id) > 1
```

### 3. CTAS (Create Table As Select)

- **Task 6: Create Summary Tables**: Used CTAS to generate new tables based on query results - each book and total book_issued_cnt**

```sql
CREATE TABLE book_cnts
AS
SELECT 
	b.isbn,
	book_title,
	COUNT(ist.issued_id) as no_issued
FROM books as b
JOIN
issued_status as ist
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```


### 4. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were used to address specific questions:

Task 7. **Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE category = 'Classic';
```

8. **Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category**:

```sql
SELECT
	b.category,
	SUM(b.rental_price),
	COUNT(*)
FROM books as b
JOIN
issued_status as ist
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = b.isbn
GROUP BY 1
```

9. **List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
```

10. **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details**:

```sql
SELECT 
	el.*,
	b.manager_id,
	e2.emp_name as manager
FROM employees as el
JOIN
branch as b
ON b.branch_id = el.branch_id
JOIN
employees as e2
ON b.manager_id = e2.emp_id
```


Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold 7 USD**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books_price_greater_than_seven
AS
SELECT * FROM books
WHERE rental_price > 7

SELECT * FROM books_price_greater_than_seven
```

Task 12: **Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned**

```sql
SELECT 
	DISTINCT ist.issued_book_name
FROM issued_status as ist
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON ist.issued_id = rs.issued_id
WHERE rs.return_id IS NULL

SELECT * FROM return_status

```

## Reports

- **Database Schema**: Detailed table structures and relationships.
- **Data Analysis**: Insights into book categories, employee salaries, member registration trends, and issued books.
